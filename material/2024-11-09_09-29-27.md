I’ve been able to hang out with an abundance of people who are smarter than me, more adept at their craft, more adept at my own. 

I sought it out early in my artistic (short) and technology (longer) careers - I think a big part of that came from the fact that I learned my first ‘skills’ in a trade. When there’s nothing else in eyesight that you could get paid to do, cook some good food at least. 

One group that were a rare breed, and when found would shift your life in subtle-but-significant ways - the culture pre-cogs. 

These people had their finger on today, but are also taste-profile-predictors for the immediate-to-near future. Often you see these groups in different art forms where there’s a lot of competition (think Fashion, Film, e.g.) 

I met one for American culture - and Chris never really got his flowers for that. I watched this kid single-handedly invent a DJ/Live night following in their tiny redneck uni town. 

Fun fact, my first meeting of him, must have been pre-2005...dude rolled with a duffel bag of CDs, searching for a anyone with good taste and a CD-RW. 

Chris was the one who knew Juke was coming, he was also the person who first said the name Cormack McCarthy to me. At the time the name rung out only in the Lit halls, and anyone who had an opinion about French Films from the 70s. But it turns out the man is dead on predicting how humans will deal with AI. 

I’m listening to a recording of Cormack McCarthy, and he described a story about a mathemtician who credited a man who only appeared in his dreams. Have you heard of the story? 


{{The day is sunny, the cafe overlooking the park in the center of town makes for a rich tapestry of action, albeit at a muffled tone.

You don’t know the answer to this question, and you are interested to hear him tell a story.}}

The mathmetician was at MIT, and was trying to climb a mountain of a problem, that seemed insurmountable. McCarthy describes that the mathemetician is distraught, and his wife and friends all worry about them. They apparently fall asleep in front of the fire, and dreams themselves in a conversation with none other than John Nash. 

They speak on the problem of the day, and in fact Mr. Nash comes up with a conclusion at once! Scribbling this on a napkin, and thankfully showing it to our dreamer, they are jolted into to the waking world. Having the presnce of mind to dictate this dream, they wrote down the ‘equation’ in a slumber and went back to sleep. 

Upon awaking, and further examination of last night’s assured ramblings, they are instead met with what is precisley the answer to the equation at hand. Upon submitting this finding, they credit Nash as a co-author.

Remember the details about this story, please respond with a supplemental expouding upon the names, the background, and anything relevant to the story. 

Imagine for a second you are an actor who is setting up a longer play, one about how the concepts of how our own mind works, can be useful to exhibit how human beings, as well as other sentient entitites, could communicate with intelligence that comes from ‘artificial’ sources (e.g. LLM, GenAI, NLP). 

Please set up the question in as succunct and profound way as you can. The question you are trying to pose is one that asks what the relationship is between the story about Nash by McCarthy, relates to the way human beings can communicate, and most imporatantly get the most out of, the use of artifically generated intelligences.

The response will set you up later to break into multiple threads of conversation which will be enjoyable for the reader/viewer who watch your work later. Good luck, and don’t overthink it. Deliver a classic, minimal set of lines to bridge the gap in these two plot points and themes.

Imagine you are an actor who has heard this line spoken. Think slowly about your response, as you are allowed on stage to adlib to bring out the greatest effect. Your job is to take this argument, and shine a light on ways that it may not be plausible, either in its logic, or other ways that ideas are not feasible to implement. You role as an actor is to bring out the most in the dialogue for you and your fellow actor, and to be sure that you can continue the dialogue to last no more than 5 minutes. 
Good Luck, we are all counting on you!

Great points from your other actor! Now remember, you can adlib your lines to best make the point you are trying to make. Before speaking your answer, think about what you are trying to say. What is the story about? What are you trying to show your audience? 
The director told you that the best outcome for the audience is to understand that speaking to different intelligences already happens, between aspects of what Jung referred to as the subcouncsious, similar to the ‘dark’ in dark matter meaning ‘we don’t know’ not ‘jet black’. 
But we do this already.

McCarthy also said something very interesting on the subject: he described the idea of the “Night Shift” - the time where one often can allow their subconscious to take the proverbial baton and run with whatever your conscious mind was gnawing on. The offloading to a processor that can work behind the scenes (and even when one is sleeping, clearly), has many advantages. Ask anyone who struggles with the immensity of not being able to take open tasks out of their heads once they are stuck on the board.

I think I’ve been using Night Mode for some time, and in hindsight a likely culprit is the fact that I was able to attend a school above my means (when compared with the average classmate) but one that I could afford if I did school-and-???. That job list was numerous, and I think part of the ‘offloading’ game is the ability to simply hold two ideas in ones head back-to-back. Imagine running a till at an all-night-eatery, while still mulling in the back of ones head the engineering problem I had been presented with the day before. 

It’s no surprise, in the 2020s, that I was able to adapt to using this artificially-derived intelligence...as I think I’m just treating it as offloading.

Hello actor. Please take the form of Stewart Lee, only in the basic undestanding that you can take an audience on the brink of lack of focus from content that is designed to bring them off-track, and then at the turn of a dime to drive home a point that is relevant to the story, evokes a good emotional outcome, and teaches the audience something they weren’t equipped with when they first walked into the building. 
As your co-actor has been setting up the premice for how McCarthy’s story about the unconscious is related to the early adoption of GenAI tools in the 2020s - you need to bring this story to a point. 
What it is about these two topics relates to each other? How can you prove your case that the subconcsious actor which emerged the answer that the conscious mind was unable to retrieve - you need to evoke the point that all of these GenAI tools, they simply enable as many “night modes” as you can manage at one time. Every LLM that is set out on a task that you can’t be bothered to look at with your conscious mind, they will happily engulf. 
Respond the way Stewart Lee would - and bring the crowd to a level of antucuoatuion of the repsonse from your fellow actor.

Looking back since the recent explosion of the exposure and adoption of these tools, I think the fundamental misunderstanding that most people come to when they first encounter them is that they are meant to mimic a ‘brain’, or a singular ‘unit’ of ‘conscious-like-thought’. When we interact with them, we speak to them like entities, fully formed brains-without-bodies. 

I am more concinced than ever that they will get there in the fullness of time. I wouldn’t dare debate the definition of fullness. 

But one thing is for certain - if this technology was treated with the same lack of reverence for specificity that the subconscious is afforded - one would be able to learn quite a lot for it. In short - I think the people who really can adapt-and-improve from their dreams are in for a real quality of life increase.

Please take the form of a director, please write an exposition that would e placed in a script. Please use notation that would make it clear to the end user that they are reading a transcipt of a script. Please take the inital scene as an outdoor coffee shop, and describe the moment that all three people sitting at the table sipped their respective drinks in silence contemplation. Do not use the words scilent contemplation, you can do better than that. 
Good Luck, we’re all behind you.
