Take a moment and induldge the idea for just a second...

When you first are told the story of Adam and Eve, if you're like those that grew up around me, you don't really think about the fact that someone was told that story the first time. When you think about it, the story kind of makes a lot of sense when you're going around trying to pitch your new religion. 

There's a group of people, who very well got on wearing what they wanted (nothing but a leaf?), eating whatever fruit they wanted. No fruit was special, everything was kind of alright. 

Enter stage left: invisible God who has an opinion about everything, not least of which your clothes, and a game about 'better not' eating one of the apples. 

Once you wake up to this new way of thinking, you've not got 'the knowledge'. 

Get ready for the reast of the miserable painful world by following along it.
