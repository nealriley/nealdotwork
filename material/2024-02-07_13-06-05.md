I beleive truly, that the shift from on-prem, delivered, and static (or at least stable) software - to one of SaaS - fundamnetally changes the economic landscape of the Open Source support infrastructure. 

A history of Open Source would be helpful here to back up or refute these assumptions, but I do believe that the shifting model of how software is consumed by indivials and organizations is calling into question whether the 20th century ways of working continue to work. 

The history of open source communities can be traced back to the early days of computing, where software was often shared and modified among academics and hobbyists. In the 1950s and 1960s, computer scientists at research institutions such as MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab and Stanford University's Computer Science Department freely exchanged ideas, code, and algorithms. This collaborative culture was fueled by the belief that software should be treated as a shared resource, accessible to all who wanted to learn from it or build upon it.

As computers became more widespread in the 1970s and 1980s, commercial interests began to dominate the software industry. Software companies started treating their code as proprietary and guarded it fiercely, making it difficult for individuals to access and modify. However, a movement of hackers and activists continued to advocate for open source principles. In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and initiated the development of the GNU operating system, which was intended to be a free alternative to proprietary systems like Unix.

The term "open source" was coined in 1998 by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), a group of software developers who wanted to promote the use of open source software in commercial businesses. They recognized that the term "free software" could be confusing to some people, as it could imply a lack of cost rather than freedom of access and modification. The OSI created the Open Source Definition, which outlined the criteria for software to be considered open source.

Open source communities began to flourish in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the rise of web technologies like Linux, Apache, and MySQL. These projects attracted large numbers of contributors who collaborated on developing and improving the code. As more businesses started adopting open source software, they realized that it could offer benefits like cost savings, flexibility, and innovation. Today, open source communities are a vital part of the technology ecosystem, with many major corporations like IBM, Microsoft, and Google actively contributing to and supporting them.
