Many who travel to San Fransisco never make it off of the peninsula of "The City", but for my money (which was stolen once outside of Lake Merritt station) the East Bay has a soul that San Francisco seems to almost completely have lost. Mind you, this was a while ago, so who knows what radical changes have happened in since. 

Once such microcosm is Berkeley, California. It was the first place I'd seen an Anti-Nuclear street sign, and protestors on the way to a march in the subway. Its also the home of Roger the instrument maker. 

I'd been working the soldering iron for him for a good few months, and we were on a special outing to the local upmarket hamburger joint. Often we would careen down from the Berkeley Hills. Though not a terribly long distance, twere one following a crow, the winding roads made for quite a trek.
