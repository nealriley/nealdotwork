title: Helping Artists
prompt: 
---

I've had the pleasure in my career to work with a number of talented artists, in semi-rare cases as a collaborator, but often as a supporter in one form or fashion. It's often misunderstood what _support_ artists need. 

Financial support never hurts, but it just one of many ways that artists can use a hand. It can be as simple as positive feedback, raw material, specialist knowledge. An undenaiable influence of the 21st century is the role that technology can play in building a business, if not creating new forms of artistic expression. 

Not all artistic endeavours can utilize 21st century tech, but nearly all business models can be aided by its use.
