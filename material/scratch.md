Evolution. 

The concept of evolution scares the hell out of me, not specifrically because I don't understand it fully (I profess early that I do not), but it's strictly for the fact of what I do understand. Evolution, and it's constiutent practices (natural selection, et al) throw into question to me what it is to be an organism, let alone a human being. 

The discourse of the growing right-wing, anti-intellectual strain that we find ourselves in in the early 21st centure shows a cataclysmic ignorance to the underlying principles of evolution.
