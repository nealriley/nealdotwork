I was born in 1984, to a math teacher and an army man. As with many familes I'm sure, the combination made for its benefits and challenges. One difference that I experienced from a very young age was my frequent moves, as the Army seemed to always need us in a new place. The world of the army is one that deserves its own exposition - however the point I raise is one of frequent movement. 

A shifting frame of reference for a child going through adolescense is both a blessing and a curse - the blessing comes in the form of a nearing-objective frame of reference when it comes to cultural norms and practices. Likewise, many of the 'brats' are forced early into situations where they need to create friends with absolute strangers. 

The obvious curse - not everyone comes out unscathed. The isolation can take its toll, and the echo chamber can be deafening.
