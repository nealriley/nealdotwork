## The Marconi Metaphor

It is hard for me to describe, in brief or otherwise, what inherently I understand about the AI revolution but have yet to articulate. The general idea is that of a 'permeating' innovation - the steam engine to the industrial revolution. (Davos Link) - and others. 

I've settled on what that I really enjoy, which is that of Marconi. In the grand scheme of things, Marconi and possibly Tesla deserve an astonishing amount more credit than they currently recieve. If you think about it, the only way that most of our lives are so interwined with each other...is that of the permeation of the radio wave. 

It is so ubiquitous that it's easy to forget a time where when you were connecting with your friends to play games you were building token rings. 

Artificial intelligence, the methods we've discovered that allow for the inference and manipulation of the languages we've been able to develop thus far as a species. The technology, the capability, the methodology, the phraseology that we develop - all of this will be permeated with this kind of capability. 

Permeation does not necessarily mean replacement, nor does it necessarily hold a pre-defined path. If one considers the example of the iphone - it is obvious that a phone is much better when used 'wirelessly' than to have to plug into a switch board every time one wanted to speak. It also means your shirt can get the weather updates. 

Take this example with AI - would any product/service/radio-connected-thing: be better served with a component of automatic inference in its offering? Not to mention the use of such an infernce machine in said product/service/etc.'s construction. 

This is going to be a wild century.
